My name is Jia Xu, and I was born in Wuxi, China. My passion for data science has led me to pursue a Data Analytics Master of Science in Social Policy degree (MSSPDA) at the University of Pennsylvania. Inspired by real-world problems in the fields of finance and health, I am driven to learn and apply data science and analytics skills to make a meaningful impact in these areas.

I currently hold positions as a research assistant at the [Shen Lab, Perelman School of Medicine](https://www.med.upenn.edu/shenlab/), where I focus on developing and applying data science methods to extract actionable insights from complex biomedical and health data. Additionally, I am a research assistant in the political science department at the University of Pennsylvania, working collaboratively with UC Berkeley and Columbia University to measure the pro/anti government bias of different TV stations using NLP techniques.

With an undergraduate degree in mathematics and applied mathematics and ongoing graduate studies in social policy and data analytics, I am passionate about leveraging my expertise in both health and business settings. My talent for analyzing complex data sets and my keen eye for detail have allowed me to develop a proven track record of success in various data science roles, from conducting intricate data analysis and modeling to designing innovative data-driven strategies and solutions.

Driven by my desire to make a positive difference in the world, I bring a unique combination of technical expertise and strategic vision to every project I undertake. Whether working in the healthcare industry to develop more effective treatments and therapies or partnering with businesses to optimize operations and drive growth, I am committed to leveraging data science for good.

I am passionate about learning and continuously seek new opportunities to challenge myself and apply my skills to drive meaningful outcomes. Thank you for taking the time to visit my personal website, and I look forward to exploring how I can contribute to your team or organization.
