My name is Jia Xu (Name in Chinese: 徐嘉). I was born in Wuxi, China. Motivated for a data science career, I am currently pursuing a Data Analytics Master of Science in Social Policy degree (MSSPDA) at University of Pennsylvania. My career goal is to become a data scientist / data analyst after I graduate in May, 2023, and I'm actively looking for data analyst/scientist full-time roles for new grad based in Shanghai / Suzhou / Beijing / Shenzhen / Wuxi.

I'm passionate about learning and applying data Science and analytics skills into the field of finance and health inspired by real-world tough problems. 

Currently I'm also a research assistant at [Shen Lab, Perelman School of Medicine](https://www.med.upenn.edu/shenlab/) focusing on developing and applying data science methods for discovering actionable knowledge from complex biomedical and health data.
