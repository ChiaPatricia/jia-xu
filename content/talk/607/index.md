title: "MSSP 607: Practical Programming for Data Science"
subtitle: "Programming Language: Python"
excerpt: "This course familiarizes me with the core concepts of programming and the practice of software development for data-intensive applications in industry and government. After this course, I am now comfortable (1) writing code to save and load from files and spreadsheets into basic data structures like strings, lists, and maps; (2) manipulating data with code to perform tasks like generating aggregate statistics and filtering data into subsets; (3) effectively communicating findings from interactive, exploratory programming with others; and (4) working with technical teams, using best practices of software development when building line- of-business applications."
