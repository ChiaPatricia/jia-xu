title: "MSSP/SWRK 730: Community Mapping"
subtitle: "Programming Language: ArcGis, SQL"
excerpt: "This course is intended as a hands-on introduction to vector GIS using ArcView 10 software. Vector GIS data are appropriate for modeling geographic objects, 
such as bounded areas (census tracts or service districts), specific locations (buildings or events such as crimes), and networks (streets). After this course, I developed 
skills necessary for carrying out basic GIS projects and for advanced GIS coursework and applied to urban history, health, criminology and social services. The class also help me developed an understanding of what is spatial, when GIS is appropriate for answering 
question, and to develop an awareness of the power issues involved in map-making. By the end of this course, I am familiar enough with ArcGIS 10 to find, map, and analyze data using basic GIS tools and be able to teach myself additional GIS skills using the help files, online materials, and software manuals.
