title: "Evaluating Academic Performance of Students Learning in Open University"
subtitle: "MSSP 608 Practical Machine Learning Methods Final Project"
excerpt: "Predicting students’ academic performance at school using regression methods is not a new area of interest. Machine learning methods, however, are relatively new in this field and it has been flourishing in recent years. According to Ghorbani and Ghousi (2020), due to technological advancements, predicting students’ performance at school is among the most beneficial and significant research topics nowadays. Therefore, we believe that it is a meaningful area for us to focus on and we decide to analyze the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset to study the student’s academic performance."
