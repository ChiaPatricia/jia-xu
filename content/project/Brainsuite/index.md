excerpt: BrainSuite is a collection of open source software tools that enable largely
  automated processing of magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the human brain. The
  major functionality of these tools is to extract and parameterize the inner and
  outer surfaces of the cerebral cortex, to segment and label gray and white matter
  structures, and to analyze diffusion imaging data. BrainSuite also provides several
  tools for visualizing and interacting with the data.

# Overview

![Overview](BrainSuite_Presentation_页面_02.jpg)

BrainSuite comes as an interactive tool with GUI support, which enables researchers to work without specialized programming knowledge. However, for those comfortable with coding, customizable workflow is also available through BrainSuite module in Nipype Interface.
For all the cool things about BrainSuite, why don’t we go ahead into our demo highlights.
