### [PennAITech](https://www.pennaitech.org/)
The overarching goal of the Penn Artificial Intelligence and Technology (PennAITech) Collaboratory for Healthy Aging is to identify, develop, evaluate, commercialize, and disseminate innovative technology and artificial intelligence (AI) methods and software to support older adults and those with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) in their home environment. The Collaboratory is motivated by the need for a comprehensive pipeline from technology-based monitoring of older adults in the home, collection and processing monitoring data, integration of those data with clinical data from electronic health records, analysis with cutting-edge AI methods and software, and deployment of validated AI models at point of care for decision support.

### Ethics and Policy in Alzheimer’s Disease
Existing artificial intelligence algorithms can now predict Alzheimer's disease with a high degree of accuracy. By pointing out drug mechanisms of action, algorithms can help identify new, undiscovered therapeutic targets. However, there is still a lack of transparency, and fairness in the implementation of these algorithms. We are now providing a fair risk analysis for these algorithms.
