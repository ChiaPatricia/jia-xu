### Abstract
This study developed the relatively simple mathematical model by adding a radiation effect and transverse magnetic field to the physical model, taking into account heat and mass transfer of a permeable, saturated porous medium, infinite oscillating cylindrical plate. In comparison, magnetohydrodynamics reality flow pattern in most earlier works was ignored in porous media. We have performed a semi-analytical method for numerical inverse Laplace transformation into PDEs of radiation on Newtonian fluidsâ€™ heat and mass transfer. The numerical stability method is used to analyze the influence of parameter variation for different values of M and N. We took into account both the local flow velocity distribution and concentration profile with the effect of Sc and time t and the skin friction against time t. There are several variations examined between the heat transfer under the cylinder boundary conditions and the plane boundary conditions. The findings given by empirical and numerical approaches are in good agreement. As seen in the literature, the numerical results on the local flow velocity agree closely with the solutions available. Our observations, meanwhile, show that the rate of heat transfer can be boosted using a magnetic field. The curved surface of the boundary configuration will restrain velocity and the temperature rise, while it has little effect on the mass transfer rate.
